## Full-Stack / AI Developer 🇨🇦

I help businesses and projects **turn AI ideas into reliable production software** 🤖 — not just demos or slide decks.  

I do this because most AI projects fail in the wild if they lack real-world robustness and maintainability.  

I build **stateful AI agents and full-stack systems** using simple, debug-friendly designs that survive production. I focus on shipping working code, fixing models, and making systems predictable and maintainable.

> Fixing models 🔧  
> Politely blaming myself 🇨🇦  

Philosophy I live by:  
- Agents need state, not vibes 🧠  
- Simple systems beat clever ones 🛠️  
- If it can’t be debugged, it’s probably not finished 🐛
